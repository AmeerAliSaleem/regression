# Regression techniques in sci-kit learn
An exploration of regression techniques using scikit-learn. We shall discuss, and demonstrate linear regression, decision trees and ensemble models in actions, as well as discussing their individual utilities. I also include some brief comments on the mathematics behind how these models work. The context of the following projects has been provided by the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Learn</a> platform. You can find out more about the specific programme that I'm currently following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/dp-100?tab=tab-learning-paths">here</a>.
