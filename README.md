# An exploration of Machine Learning techniques in Python
An exploration into different methods of models for Machine Learning. We shall cover regression, classification, clustering, neural nets and more! I also include some brief comments on the mathematics behind how these models work. The context of the following projects has been provided by the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Learn</a> platform. You can find out more about the specific programme that I'm currently following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/dp-100?tab=tab-learning-paths">here</a>.
Covered so far: regression
